# Australian companies providing work visa sponsorship

Australian companies that provide work visas (and/or relocation) to their employees (mainly tech).
The links below are for the career pages, not the main company website. Some companies listed below have mentioned visa sponsorship/relocation on StackOverflow jobs or communicated over email for **certain tech roles** and the **"right"** candidates. 

The Australian Immigration Department needs to catch up with the UK Immigration Department. UK one has an [official public list](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-workers) of thousands (last count ~30K) that can sponsor people. [Tier 2](https://www.gov.uk/tier-2-general) visa is the skilled job one. 

Update Jan-2022, a [long list of 70 pages PDF](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/request/6369/response/17729/attach/4/fa%20200600144%20documents%20released.pdf?cookie_passthrough=1) has been found on [Right To know](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/request/list_of_accredited_sponsors) which lists 1000s of companies that have sponsored employees in temporary work visa. This can be a great list to do a reverse job search. Still, some companies might have stopped doing work visas in the past 2 years because of the pandemic.

## Important update

Update Mar-2024, The Department of Home Affairs website - [Disclosure logs](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/access-and-accountability/freedom-of-information/disclosure-logs/2024) section has lists of [Standard Business Sponsorship](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/foi/files/2024/fa-240100298-document-released.PDF) - 3000+ companies, Accredited Sponsors for the Temporary Skill Shortage Visa [part 1](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/foi/files/2024/fa-231200584-document-released_Part1.PDF) - 1900+ companies, [part 2](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/foi/files/2024/fa-231200584-document-released_Part2.PDF) - 1900+ companies. This will be a gold mine of information if you are looking for employers who have sponsored work visas in the past.

## Scrolled this far, good!

If you have come this far you are looking for tech jobs in Australia. Lucky for you, check [AU Tech Jobs](https://app.autechjobs.com) for tech jobs in Australia from 85+ companies with a focus on work visa sponsorship.

If you are looking for tech jobs to relocate to other parts of the world (especially Europe), please visit [Relocate.me](https://relocate.me). It is a great platform for people looking to relocate with jobs. The country guides in Relocate.me with relocation tips and expat stories are very useful.

## Before applying for jobs

Before applying for (tech) jobs in Australia, please learn about the [visa 482](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-skill-shortage-482) and the [conditions](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-skill-shortage-482/medium-term-stream) for lodging the visa. For example, 482 medium-term stream require at least 2 years of relevant work experience.

Please look at the [official list](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/working-in-australia/skill-occupation-list) of skilled occupations to verify that your occupation is in that list. For example, `digital marketing` is not on that list. An easy way to find tech-related occupations is to search for "ACS" on that page because all tech occupations would be accessed by the Australian Computer Society [(ACS)](https://www.acs.org.au/).

## PRs welcome

If you know of any company that provides work visa sponsorship for tech roles please open a PR to add it. 

Starring the repo is highly recommended :) Thanks!

## Disclaimer

We don't take any responsibility for these companies sponsoring employees or are still doing so. 

Some companies only sponsor senior roles. Some of the companies have stated they `can` sponsor. So it will depend on how you would approach them, the role and your level of skills and experience. If you think any company above should be removed from the list please send a PR.
