## Disclaimer

Most companies in the above list have been pulled in from [StackOverflow Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?l=Australia&d=50&u=Km&v=true) search with visa sponsor flag. We don't take any responsibility of these companies sponsoring employees. 

Some companies only sponsor senior roles. Some of the companies have stated they `can` sponsor. So it will depend on how you would approach them, the role and your level of skills and experience. If you think any company above should be removed from the list please send a PR.
