# Australian companies providing work visa sponsorship

Australian companies that provide work visa (and/or relocation) to their employees (mainly tech).
The links below are of the career pages not the main company website. Some of the companies listed below have mentioned visa sponsorship/relocation on StackOverflow jobs or communicated over email for **certian tech roles** and the **"right"** candidates. 

If you work for a company in Australia that provices visa sponsorship to its employees, please add your employer as a PR. Here is an example [PR](https://github.com/geshan/au-companies-providing-work-visa-sponsorship/pull/32). 

A searchable sort-able and group-able version of the list of companies below is available on [air table](https://airtable.com/shrgB7IeiaGmIkGug/tblimdYn6HhmTYmD3).

## Before applying for jobs

Before applying for (tech) jobs in Australia, please do learn about the [visa 482](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-skill-shortage-482) and the [conditions](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-skill-shortage-482/medium-term-stream) for lodging the visa. For example, 482 medium-term stream requires least 2 years relevant work experience.

Please do have a look at the [official list](https://archive.homeaffairs.gov.au/trav/work/work/skills-assessment-and-assessing-authorities/skilled-occupations-lists/combined-stsol-mltssl) of skilled occupations to verify that your occupation is in that list. For example, `digital marketing` is not in that list. An easy way to find tech related occupation is search for "ACS" on that page because all tech occupations would be accessed by Australian Computer Society [(ACS)](https://www.acs.org.au/).

## PRs welcome

If you know of any company that provides work visa sponsorship for tech roles please open a PR to add them. Thanks!

## Disclaimer

Most companies in the above list have been pulled in from [StackOverflow Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?l=Australia&d=50&u=Km&v=true) search with visa sponsor flag. We don't take any responsibility of these companies sponsoring employees or are still doing so. 

Some companies only sponsor senior roles. Some of the companies have stated they `can` sponsor. So it will depend on how you would approach them, the role and your level of skills and experience. If you think any company above should be removed from the list please send a PR.
