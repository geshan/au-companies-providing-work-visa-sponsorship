# Australian companies providing work visa sponsorship

Australian companies that provide work visa (and/or relocation) to their employees (mainly tech).
The links below are of the career pages not the main company website. Some of the companies listed below have mentioned visa sponsorship/relocation on StackOverflow jobs or communicated over email for **certian tech roles** and the **"right"** candidates. 

The Australian Immigration department needs to play serious catchup with the UK Immigration department. UK one has an [official public list](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-workers) of thousands (last count ~30K) that can sponsor people. [Tier 2](https://www.gov.uk/tier-2-general) visa is the skilled job one. 

Update Jan-2022, a [long list of 70 pages PDF](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/request/6369/response/17729/attach/4/fa%20200600144%20documents%20released.pdf?cookie_passthrough=1) has been found on [Right To know](https://www.righttoknow.org.au/request/list_of_accredited_sponsors) which lists 1000s of companies that have sponsored employees in temporary work visa. This can be a great list to do a reverse job search. Still, some companies might have stopped doing work visa in the past 2 years because of the pandemic.

If you work for a company in Australia that provides visa sponsorship to its employees, please add your employer as a PR. Here is an example [PR](https://github.com/geshan/au-companies-providing-work-visa-sponsorship/pull/32). 

A searchable sort-able and group-able version of the list of companies below is available on [air table](https://airtable.com/shrgB7IeiaGmIkGug/tblimdYn6HhmTYmD3).

## Scrolled this far, good!

If you have come this far you are looking for tech jobs in Australia. Lucky for you, check [AU Tech Jobs](https://app.autechjobs.com) for tech jobs in Australia from 85+ companies with a focus on work visa sponsorship.

If you are looking for tech jobs to relocate to other parts of the world (especially Europe), please do visit [Relocate.me](https://relocate.me). It is a great platform for people looking to relocate with jobs. The country guides in Relocate.me with relocaiton tips and expat stories are very useful.

## Before applying for jobs

Before applying for (tech) jobs in Australia, please do learn about the [visa 482](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-skill-shortage-482) and the [conditions](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-skill-shortage-482/medium-term-stream) for lodging the visa. For example, 482 medium-term stream requires at least 2 years relevant work experience.

Please do have a look at the [official list](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/working-in-australia/skill-occupation-list) of skilled occupations to verify that your occupation is in that list. For example, `digital marketing` is not in that list. An easy way to find tech related occupation is search for "ACS" on that page because all tech occupations would be accessed by Australian Computer Society [(ACS)](https://www.acs.org.au/).

## PRs welcome

If you know of any company that provides work visa sponsorship for tech roles please open a PR to add it. 

Starring the repo is highly recommended :) Thanks!

## Disclaimer

Most companies in the above list have been pulled in from [StackOverflow Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?l=Australia&d=50&u=Km&v=true) search with visa sponsor flag. We don't take any responsibility of these companies sponsoring employees or are still doing so. 

Some companies only sponsor senior roles. Some of the companies have stated they `can` sponsor. So it will depend on how you would approach them, the role and your level of skills and experience. If you think any company above should be removed from the list please send a PR.
